project ideas

- use symbolic regression to infer new equations of physics from common datasets in physics
- write an algorithm that filters ideal homes from common housing datasets in the US
- write an algorithm that detects insider sentiment for stocks on the SEC database
- write an algorithm that predicts outcomes of sports games
- create an algorithm that remixes a song based on other music
- create a cellular automata algorithm that can perform basic DNA replication

to-do

1. open separate repos for each project idea
2. collect required datasets for each repo
3. attempt to solve problem from scratch
